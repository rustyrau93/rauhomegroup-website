            <h2 class="section-title">About Encinitas</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Nestled along six miles of pristine Pacific coastline about 25 miles north of downtown San Diego, Encinitas embodies the authentic California beach lifestyle. The city is actually a collection of five distinct neighborhoods, each with its own personality: classic surf-town Leucadia, family-friendly Cardiff-by-the-Sea, rural Olivenhain, modern New Encinitas, and the vibrant downtown area along historic Highway 101.</p>

                <p>What sets Encinitas apart is its unique blend of counterculture cool and family-friendly appeal. The Self-Realization Fellowship's golden-domed meditation gardens overlook Swami's Beach, one of Southern California's most iconic surf breaks. The legendary San Diego Botanic Garden sprawls across 37 acres of rare plants and specialty gardens. And throughout the city, you'll find an eclectic mix of surf shops, yoga studios, farm-to-table restaurants, craft breweries, and wellness centers that reflect the community's health-conscious, environmentally aware values.</p>

                <p>The residents of Encinitas are surfers, yogis, entrepreneurs, artists, and families who've chosen to prioritize quality of life over the urban hustle. Despite the luxury real estate market, the town maintains a refreshingly unpretentious vibe where billionaires and surf instructors share the same beach access and coffee shops. It's a place where you can start your morning with sunrise yoga, spend your afternoon catching waves, and end your day watching the sunset from a cliff-top restaurant, all without ever leaving your neighborhood.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Life in Encinitas revolves around the ocean, wellness, and community. Mornings often start at Moonlight Beach where families set up for the day while surfers paddle out at dawn. The coastline offers something for everyone: gentle waves at Cardiff Reef for beginners, powerful swells at Swami's for experienced surfers, and pristine sand at Leucadia's secret spots for those seeking solitude. Stand-up paddleboarders cruise the calm waters of Cardiff Lagoon while tide-poolers explore the rocky shores at low tide.</p>

                <p>The dining scene reflects Encinitas' health-conscious culture. You'll find açai bowl cafes next to gourmet taco shops, organic juice bars alongside craft breweries, and upscale farm-to-table restaurants serving locally-sourced seafood with ocean views. The Sunday farmers market on Vulcan Avenue draws crowds for fresh produce, artisan bread, and live music. Coast Highway 101 (the historic Pacific Coast Highway) serves as the town's main artery, lined with surf shops that have been family-owned for generations, yoga studios offering beachfront classes, and boutiques selling everything from handmade jewelry to sustainable surf wear.</p>

                <p>Community events bring residents together throughout the year. The Encinitas Street Fair attracts over 50,000 visitors for arts, crafts, and live entertainment. The Cardiff Kook Run celebrates the town's famous (and frequently decorated) surfer statue. Summer concerts at Moonlight Beach pack the sand with families enjoying music under the stars. And every Sunday evening, locals gather on the bluffs to watch the sunset, often accompanied by impromptu drumming circles and fire dancers, a tradition that captures the town's bohemian spirit perfectly.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Encinitas is served by two highly-rated school districts: the Encinitas Union Elementary School District (K-6) and San Dieguito Union High School District (7-12), both consistently ranking among San Diego County's top performers. Families are drawn to the area specifically for schools like Ocean Knoll Elementary, Paul Ecke Central Elementary, and Diegueno Middle School, which boast strong academic programs, dedicated teachers, and active parent involvement. La Costa Canyon High School and San Dieguito Academy offer rigorous college prep curricula with impressive Advanced Placement offerings and graduation rates exceeding 95%.</p>

                <p>Beyond traditional public schools, Encinitas offers excellent private and alternative education options. The Rhoades School provides progressive K-8 education emphasizing creativity and critical thinking. Sunset High School serves students seeking smaller class sizes and personalized learning. Several Montessori schools cater to early childhood development, while Cardiff Elementary School District serves the Cardiff-by-the-Sea community with neighborhood schools that feel like extensions of the beach town lifestyle. The emphasis on outdoor education, environmental science, and wellness programs reflects the community's values throughout the educational system.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Encinitas sits perfectly positioned on the I-5 corridor, making commutes surprisingly manageable despite the coastal location. Downtown San Diego is 25 miles south (30-40 minutes), while the employment hubs of Sorrento Valley and UTC are just 15 minutes away. The Coaster commuter train stops at three stations within Encinitas (Encinitas Station, Old Encinitas, and Poinsettia), offering a relaxing alternative to freeway driving for those working in downtown San Diego or Del Mar. Many residents bike to the beach, walk to neighborhood cafes, and embrace the car-free lifestyle for daily errands, especially in downtown Encinitas and Cardiff where everything is within a mile radius.</p>

                <p>The town's walkability and bike-friendliness are major draws. The coastal rail trail connects neighborhoods, offering a scenic route for cyclists and runners from Oceanside to Solana Beach. Highway 101 features bike lanes and regular beach access points. During summer, parking near the beaches fills early, but locals know the secret spots and prefer to walk or bike anyway. The laid-back pace extends to traffic, which remains manageable compared to Los Angeles or even some San Diego neighborhoods, though peak summer weekends can see tourist congestion along the main beach areas.</p>
