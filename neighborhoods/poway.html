            <h2>🏡 Overview</h2>
            <p>Poway (pronounced "POW-way") is San Diego's premier family-oriented suburb, known for its outstanding schools, small-town feel, and abundance of parks and recreation. Nestled in the inland valleys about 20 miles north of downtown San Diego, Poway has earned its unofficial motto "The City in the Country" by maintaining a perfect balance between suburban conveniences and rural charm.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Location:</strong> North-central San Diego County, bordered by Rancho Bernardo to the west, Rancho Peñasquitos to the south, and Ramona to the northeast. The community sits in a valley surrounded by rolling hills and preserves.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Population:</strong> Approximately 50,000 residents who value excellent schools, safety, and community engagement.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What Makes It Unique:</strong> Poway stands out for its exceptional public schools (Poway Unified is consistently ranked among California's top districts), extensive parks and trail system anchored by Lake Poway, and genuine small-town atmosphere despite being minutes from major employment centers. The city has preserved its Western heritage with Old Poway Park and the annual Poway Rodeo, while offering modern amenities and top-tier youth sports programs.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Who Lives Here:</strong> Poway attracts families seeking the best schools in San Diego County, young professionals working in nearby tech/biotech hubs, established professionals desiring more space than coastal areas, empty nesters who've aged in place and love the community, and military families stationed at nearby bases. The community values education, youth activities, and civic involvement.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>🎓 Schools</h2>
            <p>Poway's exceptional schools are THE primary reason families move here. The Poway Unified School District consistently ranks among California's top districts, with multiple schools receiving state and national recognition. School quality significantly impacts property values—homes in PUSD boundaries command substantial premiums.</p>

            <h3>Top-Rated Public Schools</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Painted Rock Elementary:</strong> K-5, GreatSchools Rating 8/10 - Highly regarded with strong community support</li>

                <li><strong>Del Norte High School:</strong> Grades 9-12 - Strong athletics and performing arts</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Private School Options</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Newbridge School:</strong> K-8 school specializing in learning differences</li>
                <li><strong>Maranatha Christian School:</strong> K-12 faith-based education with strong academics</li>
                <li><strong>Templeton Academy:</strong> Private school option serving Poway families</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>District Recognition</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Poway Unified School District:</strong> Serves 34,900 students across 39 schools</li>
                <li>Consistently ranked in top 5% of California districts</li>
                <li>Multiple National Blue Ribbon Schools</li>
                <li>California Distinguished Schools awards</li>
                <li>97%+ high school graduation rate</li>
                <li>Strong AP/IB programs and college preparation</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>School Impact on Real Estate:</strong> Poway's schools are THE primary driver of property values. Families routinely pay 15-20% premiums to live in PUSD boundaries compared to neighboring districts. Properties near top elementary schools sell fastest and appreciate strongest. Many buyers purchase homes years before their children start school to secure enrollment.</p>

        <!-- Commute & Location Section -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>🚗 Commute & Location</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downtown San Diego:</strong> 20 miles, approximately 25-30 minutes via I-15</li>
                <li><strong>San Diego Airport:</strong> 25 miles, approximately 30-35 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Rancho Bernardo (tech corridor):</strong> 5 miles west, 10 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Sorrento Valley (biotech):</strong> 12 miles, 20 minutes via I-15</li>
                <li><strong>Escondido:</strong> 15 miles north, 20 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Mission Valley:</strong> 18 miles, 25 minutes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Freeway Access</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I-15 (North-South):</strong> Primary freeway running through Poway with multiple on/off ramps</li>
                <li><strong>SR-56 (East-West):</strong> Quick connection to I-5 and coastal communities (15 minutes to beach)</li>
                <li><strong>Pomerado Road:</strong> Main arterial connecting to Rancho Bernardo and Scripps Ranch</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Public Transit</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MTS Bus Routes:</strong> Several lines connecting Poway to regional transit centers</li>
                <li><strong>Park & Ride Lots:</strong> Convenient lots for carpooling</li>
                <li><strong>Bike-Friendly Roads:</strong> Designated bike lanes on major streets</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Commute Reality:</strong> Poway is car-dependent (Walk Score 30/100) but strategically located near major employment centers. Many residents work in nearby Rancho Bernardo tech companies, Sorrento Valley biotech firms, or have remote-work arrangements. The I-15 corridor provides direct north-south access, while SR-56 offers quick connections west to coastal areas. Morning commutes to downtown average 30 minutes, with reverse commutes typically faster.</p>
