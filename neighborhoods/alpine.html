            <h2>🏔️ Overview</h2>
            <p>Alpine is San Diego County's premier rural mountain community, offering a peaceful escape from urban life while remaining surprisingly accessible. Nestled in the foothills of the Cuyamaca Mountains just 30 miles east of downtown San Diego, this charming community delivers authentic country living with large acreage properties, equestrian facilities, and stunning natural beauty.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Location:</strong> East County San Diego, approximately 30 miles from downtown via I-8, situated between Santee to the west and the Cleveland National Forest to the east. The community sits at an elevation of around 1,800 feet, providing cooler temperatures and dramatic mountain views.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Population:</strong> Approximately 15,000 residents who value privacy, outdoor recreation, and a tight-knit community atmosphere. Despite the rural setting, Alpine maintains excellent schools and modern amenities.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What Makes It Unique:</strong> Alpine offers something increasingly rare in San Diego County—space. Properties with 1-10 acre lots are common, and some estates feature 20+ acres with breathtaking views. The community has maintained its rural character while attracting residents seeking both country living and smart investments. Horse properties and equestrian facilities are a defining feature, with trails connecting directly to thousands of acres of public land.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Who Lives Here:</strong> Alpine attracts families seeking quality schools and outdoor recreation, equestrian enthusiasts with horse properties, professionals willing to commute for space and value, retirees seeking peace and natural beauty, and investors recognizing East County's growth potential. The community values independence, outdoor living, and neighborly connection.</p>

                <li><strong>El Cajon:</strong> 12 miles, 15-20 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>La Mesa:</strong> 15 miles, 20 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Beaches (Ocean Beach):</strong> 35 miles, 45-55 minutes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Freeway Access</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I-8 (East-West):</strong> Direct access via Alpine Boulevard or Tavern Road—primary route to San Diego and coastal areas</li>
                <li><strong>Highway 79:</strong> Scenic route north to Julian and Cuyamaca</li>
                <li><strong>Highway 94:</strong> Alternative route connecting to I-8 and South Bay</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Public Transit</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limited Bus Service:</strong> MTS Route 864 connects Alpine to El Cajon Transit Center</li>
                <li><strong>Park & Ride:</strong> Options in nearby Santee for vanpools and carpools</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Vehicle Essential:</strong> Car ownership is necessary for daily living in Alpine</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Commute Considerations:</strong> Most Alpine residents commute west toward San Diego via I-8. Morning westbound traffic can add 10-15 minutes during peak hours (7-9 AM). However, many remote workers and retirees choose Alpine specifically to avoid daily commutes. The tradeoff of slightly longer commute times is rewarded with larger homes, more land, and significantly lower housing costs per square foot.</p>
