## Key Trends Shaping San Diego Real Estate in 2025

### 1. Inventory Is Finally Growing

After years of desperate shortage, San Diego's housing inventory has increased 22% year-over-year. This means:

- **For buyers:** More options, less competition, room to negotiate
- **For sellers:** Pricing accurately is more important than ever
- **For the market:** Moving toward healthier balance

**What's driving it:** Higher interest rates have kept more homeowners in place (the "lock-in effect"), but life events (divorce, death, job relocations) are gradually releasing inventory.

### 2. Interest Rates Are the Wildcard

Mortgage rates have fluctuated between 6.5-7.5% through early 2025. The impact:

- Every 1% rate increase reduces buying power by ~10%
- Many buyers are "rate-locked" waiting for drops
- Sellers offering rate buydowns are seeing more success

**My take:** Rates may drift down slightly, but waiting for 4% again is likely wishful thinking. Today's buyers should buy when ready and refinance later.

### 3. Price Growth Has Slowed (But Prices Aren't Dropping)

San Diego home prices continue to rise, just at a more sustainable pace:

- 2021-2022: +15-20% annual appreciation
- 2023: +5-8% appreciation
- 2024: +4-5% appreciation
- 2025 forecast: +3-5% appreciation

**Reality check:** Despite headlines about "cooling markets," San Diego home values aren't declining. They're just not skyrocketing anymore.

### 4. Luxury Market Shows Resilience

San Diego's $2M+ market remains strong, driven by:

- Tech wealth (especially from recent IPOs)
- Remote workers relocating from higher-cost cities
- International buyers returning post-pandemic
- Limited supply in premium locations

Hot luxury areas: La Jolla, Del Mar, Rancho Santa Fe, Coronado

### 5. First-Time Buyers Getting Creative

With affordability challenges, first-time buyers are adapting:

- More condo purchases (entry point around $500-600K)
- Multi-generational buying (pooling resources)
- ADU strategies (rental income to offset mortgage)
- Moving further inland for value

## What This Means for Buyers

### The Good News
- More inventory = more choices
- Less competition = fewer bidding wars
- Sellers more willing to negotiate on price, repairs, credits
- Opportunity to buy before prices rise further

### The Challenge
- Higher rates mean higher monthly payments
- Still a competitive market (just less crazy)
- Best homes still sell quickly

### Buyer Strategy for 2025
1. **Get pre-approved** with a rate lock option
2. **Target homes 30+ days on market** for better negotiating position
3. **Ask for seller concessions** (rate buydowns, closing cost credits)
4. **Don't wait for "perfect" timing** — time in market beats timing market
5. **Consider new construction** — builders offering incentives

---

## What This Means for Sellers

### The Good News
- Prices still appreciating (just slower)
- Serious buyers are out there
- Low inventory in desirable areas
- San Diego fundamentals remain strong

### The Challenge
- Buyers have more options and leverage
- Overpriced homes sit and get stale
- Days on market increasing
- May need to offer concessions

### Seller Strategy for 2025
1. **Price right from day one** — the market won't chase overpriced listings
2. **Invest in presentation** — staged homes sell faster and for more
3. **Consider rate buydowns** — can make your home more attractive
4. **Be flexible on repairs** — buyers expect more negotiation
5. **Time strategically** — spring (March-May) typically strongest

## San Diego Economic Factors

### What's Driving Demand

**Employment:** San Diego's job market remains robust
- Biotech/life sciences expanding (Illumina, Dexcom, etc.)
- Defense industry stable (largest military presence in US)
- Tech sector growing (Qualcomm HQ, tech migration from Bay Area)
- Tourism recovered to pre-pandemic levels
- Healthcare sector expanding

**Population:** Net migration still positive, though slower
- Remote workers relocating from LA, SF, Bay Area
- Retirees from colder states
- Military personnel stationed here often stay

**Constraints:** Supply remains limited

- Regulations (CEQA, coastal commission)
- NIMBYism in established neighborhoods
- Construction costs remain high

## 2025 Forecast: My Predictions

**Home Prices:** +3-5% appreciation
- San Diego's supply constraints and desirability support continued growth
- Won't see 2021-style gains, but values will increase

**Interest Rates:** 6-7% range
- May see slight decreases if inflation cools
- Don't expect dramatic drops

**Inventory:** Gradual increase
- More balance but still favoring sellers
- Won't reach true "buyer's market" levels

**Best Opportunities:**
- Buyers: Condos, inland communities, homes 30+ DOM
- Sellers: Move-in ready homes in top school districts

## The Bottom Line

San Diego's real estate market in 2025 is shifting from a frenzied seller's market toward healthier balance. For buyers, this means more opportunities and negotiating power. For sellers, it means pricing strategically and presenting homes well.

The fundamentals that make San Diego desirable—weather, beaches, jobs, lifestyle—aren't changing. Those who buy now will likely look back in 5 years glad they did.
