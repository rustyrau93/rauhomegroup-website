## The Reality of Buying Your First San Diego Home

Let's be honest: buying your first home in San Diego isn't easy. With a median home price around $950,000, it can feel impossible. But here's what most first-time buyers don't realize—there are programs, strategies, and neighborhoods that make homeownership achievable, even in this market.

I've helped dozens of first-time buyers break into the San Diego market. This guide shares everything I wish every first-time buyer knew before they started.

## Step 1: Know Your Numbers

Before looking at a single home, you need clarity on your finances.

### How Much Home Can You Afford?

The general rule: your monthly housing payment (mortgage, taxes, insurance, HOA) should be no more than 28-31% of your gross monthly income.

**Example:**
- Gross income: $150,000/year ($12,500/month)
- Max housing payment: $3,500-$3,875/month
- Approximate purchase price: $650,000-$750,000

### Down Payment Reality Check

| Down Payment % | On $700K Home | Monthly PMI |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| 3% | $21,000 | ~$350/month |
| 5% | $35,000 | ~$280/month |
| 10% | $70,000 | ~$175/month |
| 20% | $140,000 | $0 |

**Pro tip:** Don't drain your savings for 20% down. You'll need reserves for closing costs ($15-25K), moving, and emergencies.

---

## Step 2: Get Pre-Approved (Not Pre-Qualified)

There's a huge difference:
- **Pre-qualified:** Quick estimate based on what you tell the lender
- **Pre-approved:** Full verification of income, assets, credit, and debt

In San Diego's competitive market, sellers won't take you seriously without pre-approval. Get this done FIRST.

### Documents You'll Need
- 2 years of tax returns
- 2 years of W-2s (or 1099s if self-employed)
- 2 months of bank statements
- 2 months of pay stubs
- Photo ID
- List of debts and assets

### Best Lenders for First-Time Buyers
Look for lenders experienced with:
- FHA loans (lower down payment, flexible credit)
- First-time buyer programs
- Down payment assistance

---

## Step 3: Explore Down Payment Assistance Programs

Most first-time buyers don't know these exist:

## Step 4: Target the Right Neighborhoods

Not all San Diego neighborhoods are created equal for first-time buyers. Here's where to focus:

### Best Value for First-Time Buyers

**Condos/Townhomes (Under $700K)**
- Mira Mesa: $550-650K, good schools, central location
- Clairemont: $500-600K, close to beaches, established area
- Chula Vista (Eastlake): $550-700K, newer construction
- San Marcos: $500-650K, Cal State San Marcos area

**Single-Family Homes (Under $850K)**

- El Cajon: $650-800K, more affordable, improving areas

## Step 5: Understand the Buying Process

### Timeline for San Diego First-Time Buyers

| Phase | Duration | What Happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Preparation | 1-3 months | Credit repair, save, get pre-approved |
| Home Search | 1-4 months | Tour homes, make offers |
| Under Contract | 30-45 days | Inspections, appraisal, loan processing |
| Close | 1 day | Sign papers, get keys! |

**Total typical timeline: 3-6 months**

### The Offer Process

1. Find a home you love
2. I run comparable sales analysis
3. We craft competitive offer (price, terms, contingencies)
4. Submit offer with pre-approval letter
5. Negotiate (counter-offers are normal)
6. Go under contract

### What Makes an Offer Competitive
- Strong pre-approval from reputable lender
- Reasonable contingency periods
- Flexible closing date
- Clean terms (avoid asking for lots of extras)
- Personal letter to seller (sometimes helps)

---

## Step 6: Inspections & Due Diligence

NEVER skip inspections. In San Diego, watch for:

### Must-Have Inspections
- **General home inspection** ($400-600): Overall condition
- **Termite/pest inspection** ($150-200): Critical in San Diego
- **Sewer lateral inspection** ($250-400): Old pipes are common

### Situational Inspections
- **Foundation** (if cracks visible): $300-500
- **Roof** (if older): $200-400
- **Pool/spa**: $150-250
- **HVAC** (if older): $150-200

### Common San Diego Issues
- Termite damage (very common)
- Old plumbing (galvanized pipes in pre-1970 homes)
- Foundation settling (hillside homes)
- Unpermitted additions (very common)
- Aluminum wiring (1965-1973 homes)

---

## Step 7: Closing

### Closing Costs to Expect
- **Loan origination:** 0.5-1% of loan amount
- **Appraisal:** $500-800
- **Title insurance:** $1,500-3,000
- **Escrow fees:** $1,500-2,500
- **Recording fees:** $100-200
- **Prepaid taxes/insurance:** 2-6 months worth

**Budget 2-3% of purchase price for closing costs.**

### What to Bring to Closing
- Photo ID
- Cashier's check for closing funds (wire transfer preferred)
- Patience (lots of signing)

## Common First-Time Buyer Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Looking at homes before getting pre-approved
You'll fall in love with homes you can't afford. Get numbers first.

### Mistake #2: Draining savings for maximum down payment
Keep 3-6 months of expenses in reserve. Stuff happens.

### Mistake #3: Making big purchases before closing
Don't buy a car, furniture, or anything on credit. Lenders re-check before closing.

### Mistake #4: Skipping inspections to "save money"
$500 inspection can save $50,000 in hidden problems.

### Mistake #5: Not shopping mortgage rates
Get quotes from 3+ lenders. Rates vary more than you'd think.

### Mistake #6: Expecting perfection
First homes are stepping stones, not forever homes. Be realistic.
