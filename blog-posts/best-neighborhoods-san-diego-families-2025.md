## How to Choose Your San Diego Neighborhood

When helping families find their ideal neighborhood, I always ask these questions:

1. **Schools:** What grade levels and what matters most (test scores, arts, sports)?
2. **Commute:** Where do you work and what's your tolerance for driving?
3. **Beach proximity:** Must-have or nice-to-have?
4. **Budget:** What's your comfortable monthly payment?
5. **Home style:** Modern new construction or established with character?
6. **Lot size:** Important or flexible?
7. **Community:** Want organized activities or more privacy?
