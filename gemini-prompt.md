# Gemini Website Generation Prompt

## Context
I'm building a luxury real estate website for Rusty Rau, a San Diego-based realtor with 6 years of experience. He's part of the Rau Home Group.

## Design Inspiration
[Attach screenshots of Jade Mills, Altman Brothers, O Group sites]

I want this website to have:
1. A full-bleed hero section with a stunning San Diego skyline/property image
2. Dark overlay on hero for text readability
3. Bold, elegant typography
4. Navy (#1A2332) and Gold (#C9A869) accent colors
5. Minimal, clean navigation
6. Strong personal branding
7. Single prominent CTA button
8. Modern, luxury aesthetic similar to the attached inspiration

## Stylistic Guidelines
- Soft animated background effects
- Intentional micro-interactions on hover
- Smooth scroll animations
- Professional, luxury real estate feel
- Mobile responsive
- Fast loading

## Sections Needed
1. **Hero** - Full bleed image, headline, subheadline, CTA button
2. **About** - Agent photo, bio, credentials
3. **Stats** - Key numbers (years experience, homes sold, etc.)
4. **Areas** - San Diego neighborhoods served
5. **Testimonials** - Client quotes with photos if available
6. **Contact** - Form + contact info + social links
7. **Footer** - Copyright, brokerage info, DRE#

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Tailwind preferred)
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactions
- No frameworks needed - static site

## Content
[Will insert Rusty's actual content here]

## Output
Generate a complete, production-ready website with:
- index.html
- styles.css (or Tailwind classes inline)
- script.js for interactions
- Placeholder images with proper aspect ratios
